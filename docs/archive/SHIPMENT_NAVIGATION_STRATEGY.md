# Shipment Pages Navigation Strategy

## Implementation Summary

We've implemented a **multi-layered navigation approach** to expose shipment pages on the agroverse_shop site, making them easily discoverable while maintaining a clean user experience.

## Navigation Methods Implemented

### 1. **Main Navigation Menu** ✅
- Added "Shipments" link to the top navigation bar
- Positioned between "Products" and "Contact"
- Smooth scrolls to the new "Our Shipments" section

### 2. **"Our Shipments" Section** ✅
- New dedicated section on the main page (`#shipments`)
- Features 6 recent shipments in a responsive grid:
  - AGL14 (MANUFACTURING) - Oscar's Farm, 40 kg
  - AGL13 (MANUFACTURING) - Vivi's Farm, 150 kg
  - AGL10 (SALES IN PROGRESS) - Capela Velha, 5 kg
  - AGL8 (SALES IN PROGRESS) - Paulo's Farm, 330 kg
  - AGL6 (SALES IN PROGRESS) - São Jorge Farm, 22 kg
  - AGL4 (SALES IN PROGRESS) - Oscar's Farm, 300 kg
- Each card shows:
  - Shipment image
  - Status badge
  - Shipment ID
  - Key details (weight, farm, location)
  - "View Details" link
- Link to view all shipments on TrueSight DAO at the bottom

### 3. **Updated Farmer Cards** ✅
- Primary link now goes to **agroverse_shop shipment pages**
- Secondary link to TrueSight DAO ledger (smaller, less prominent)
- Clear hierarchy: "View AGL14 Shipment" → "View Full Ledger →"

### 4. **Footer Navigation** ✅
- Added "Shipments" link to footer menu
- Consistent with other footer links

## User Flow

### For QR Code Scanners:
1. User scans QR code → Lands on `/shipments/{agl}?qr_code=XXX`
2. QR code is prominently displayed
3. User can register email for tree-planting updates
4. Can navigate to full ledger on TrueSight DAO

### For Site Visitors:
1. **Discovery Path 1**: Navigation Menu → "Shipments" → Scrolls to "Our Shipments" section
2. **Discovery Path 2**: Scroll down → "Meet Our Farmers" → Click farmer card → View shipment page
3. **Discovery Path 3**: Footer → "Shipments" → Scrolls to section

## Benefits

✅ **SEO**: Internal linking improves search rankings  
✅ **Transparency**: Easy access builds customer trust  
✅ **User Education**: Visitors can explore supply chain before purchasing  
✅ **Social Sharing**: Easy to share specific shipment stories  
✅ **QR Code Integration**: Seamless experience for bag scanners

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

3. **Status Filtering**: Filter by MANUFACTURING, SALES IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED
