# Product Pages Navigation Strategy

## Overview

We have 8 product pages that need to be exposed on the agroverse_shop site, organized into two categories:
- **Retail Packs** (4 products)
- **Wholesale Bulk** (4 products)

Each product is associated with a shipment (AGL), creating a clear traceability link.

## Recommended Navigation Strategy

### 1. **Update "Products" Section on Main Page**
- Replace or enhance the current product gallery
- Add category filters: "Retail Packs" and "Wholesale Bulk"
- Show product cards with:
  - Product image
  - Product name
  - Price
  - Associated shipment badge (e.g., "From AGL8")
  - "View Product" button
  - Link to associated shipment page

### 2. **Category Pages**
- `/category/retail-packs/index.html` - Grid of all retail products
- `/category/wholesale-bulk/index.html` - Grid of all wholesale products
- Each category page shows:
  - Category description
  - Product grid with cards
  - Filter/sort options (optional)

### 3. **Product Pages**
- Maintain original URL structure: `/product-page/{slug}`
- Each product page should include:
  - Product images/gallery
  - Product name and description
  - Price and purchase options
  - **"Trace This Product" section** linking to associated shipment
  - Farm information
  - QR code information (if applicable)
  - Related products

### 4. **Cross-Linking Strategy**
- **Product → Shipment**: "View Shipment Details" button on product page
- **Shipment → Product**: "Available Products" section on shipment page
- **Category → Products**: Product cards link to individual product pages
- **Main Page → Categories**: "Shop Retail" and "Shop Wholesale" buttons

### 5. **Navigation Menu Updates**
- Add "Shop" dropdown menu with:
  - Retail Packs
  - Wholesale Bulk
  - All Products
- Or add "Shop" as a main menu item
