# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation files that were created during the development of the Agroverse Shop e-commerce platform.

## Why Archived?

These files contain:
- Historical planning documents
- Implementation notes from development phases
- Troubleshooting guides for issues that have been resolved
- Setup guides that have been superseded by the main README.md

All essential information has been consolidated into the main `README.md` file in the project root.

## Current Essential Documentation

The following files remain in the main `docs/` directory:
- `SCRIPT_PROPERTIES_REFERENCE.md` - Complete guide to Google App Script properties
- `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` - Local development setup
- `CHECKOUT_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed checkout system overview
- `README.md` - Documentation index

## Archived Files

This archive contains 30+ historical documentation files that are no longer actively maintained but may contain useful context for understanding the project's evolution.
