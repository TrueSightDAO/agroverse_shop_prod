# Shipment Status & Farm Pages Strategy

## 1. Dynamic Shipment Status from Google Sheet

### Current State
- Shipment status is **hardcoded** in HTML (e.g., "MANUFACTURING", "SALES IN PROGRESS", "COMPLETED")
- Status needs to be fetched dynamically from Google Sheet: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GE7PUq-UT6x2rBN-Q2ksogbWpgyuh2SaxJyG_uEK6PU/edit?gid=483234653`

### Implementation Plan

#### A. Google Apps Script Extension
Create/update a Google Apps Script to expose shipment status:

**New Endpoint:**
```
GET https://script.google.com/macros/s/{SCRIPT_ID}/exec?shipmentId=AGL8
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T12:00:00.000Z",
  "shipmentId": "AGL8",
  "status": "MANUFACTURING",
  "treesSold": 42,
  "weight": "330 kg",
  "date": "2024-10-15",
  "farm": "La do Sitio",
  "farmer": "Paulo"
}
```

**Google Apps Script Function:**
```javascript
function getShipmentStatus(shipmentId) {
  // Read from Google Sheet
  // Find row matching shipmentId
  // Return status and other details
}
```

#### B. Frontend Integration
Update all shipment pages to:
1. Fetch status dynamically on page load
2. Display loading state while fetching
3. Fallback to static value if API fails
4. Update status badge styling based on status

**JavaScript Pattern:**
```javascript
async function updateShipmentStatus(shipmentId) {
  const statusElement = document.getElementById('shipment-status');
  statusElement.textContent = 'Loading...';
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`API_URL?shipmentId=${shipmentId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    statusElement.textContent = data.status;
    statusElement.className = `status-badge status-${data.status.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')}`;
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to static value
    statusElement.textContent = 'SALES IN PROGRESS'; // Default
  }
}
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Real-time status updates without page regeneration
- ✅ Single source of truth (Google Sheet)
- ✅ Consistent status across all pages
- ✅ Easy status management

## 2. Individual Farm Pages Strategy

### Concept
Create dedicated pages for each farm that serve as a hub for:
- Farm story and history
- All shipments from that farm

- Farm location and map
- Regenerative practices

### Cross-Linking Strategy

```

│   ├── AGL4 → Shipment Page
│   └── AGL14 → Shipment Page
├── Products Section
│   ├── Ceremonial Cacao → Product Page
│   └── Criollo Beans → Product Page
└── Transparency
    └── TrueSight DAO → Ledger

Shipment Page
└── Farm Section
    └── "View Farm Profile" → Farm Page

└── Farm Details
    └── "View Farm Profile" → Farm Page
```

### Design Considerations

- Consistent with existing agroverse_shop styling
- Hero section with farm imagery

## Recommendation

**Start with:**
1. ✅ Implement dynamic shipment status fetching (high value, low effort)
2. ✅ Create farm pages for top 3 farms (Oscar, Paulo, Vivi)
3. ✅ Add cross-links between farms, shipments, and products

**Then:**
4. Create remaining farm pages
5. Add farm filtering to category pages
6. Add "Farms" section to main navigation
