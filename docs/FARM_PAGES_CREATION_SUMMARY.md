## Navigation Updates

### Top-Level Navigation Structure
**Updated across all pages:**
```
Home | Mission | Products | Farms ⭐ | Shipments | Contact
```

**Farms is now primary** (before Shipments) because:
- Farms are the brand differentiator
- Better information architecture (parent → children)
- More scalable (fewer farms than shipments)
- Better for storytelling and SEO

### Pages Updated
- ✅ Main `index.html`
- ✅ All 11 shipment pages
- ✅ All 8 product pages
- ✅ All 2 category pages
- ✅ All 5 farm pages (Oscar, Paulo, Vivi, Fazenda Santa Ana, Fazenda Capelavelha)

### Shipment Page Updates
- **AGL2**: Updated to reflect Fazenda Santa Ana as source (was listed as Coopercabruca)
- **AGL10**: Updated to reflect Fazenda Capelavelha (was listed as Capela Velha Fazenda)
- Both shipment pages now link to their respective farm pages
