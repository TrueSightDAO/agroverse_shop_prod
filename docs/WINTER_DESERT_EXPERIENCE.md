   - Special "Experience" badge
   - Different styling (accent color border)
   - List of all gatherings
   - Link to Facebook group
3. **Map marker** - Added to map with star icon (★) to distinguish from partner venues
4. **Updated journey description** to clarify:
   - Seasonal timeline (Spring to Winter)
   - Self-guided nature
   - Winter desert as final destination
